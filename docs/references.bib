abstract="The Model-View-Controller design pattern is one of the most important design patterns in computer science. Whereas most patterns address specific problems, Model-View-Controller (MVC) describes the architecture of a system of objects. It can be applied to isolated subsystems or entire applications. The Model-View-Controller design pattern is also less clearly defined than many other patterns, leaving a lot of latitude for alternate implementations. It's more a philosophy than a recipe.",
