abstract="The Model-View-Controller design pattern is one of the most important design patterns in computer science. Whereas most patterns address specific problems, Model-View-Controller (MVC) describes the architecture of a system of objects. It can be applied to isolated subsystems or entire applications. The Model-View-Controller design pattern is also less clearly defined than many other patterns, leaving a lot of latitude for alternate implementations. It's more a philosophy than a recipe.",

@article{schroeder1961natural, author={Schroeder, Manfred R.}, journal={Journal of The Audio Engineering Society}, title={Natural {S}ounding {A}rtificial {R}everberation}, year={1961}, number={203}, month={October},
	annote = {This paper is one of several breakthrough papers on artificial reverberation, published in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society (JAES), a reputable source for audio development. In this paper, M. R. Schroeder introduces a method of artifically extending a sound without the issues present in other reverberators of the time. Extending sound through springs introduces several overtones, which are unwanted in this case. In this paper he introduces the ``All-Pass Filter'' as a method of extending sound, which reverberates sound without any kind of overtones in the signal.}
