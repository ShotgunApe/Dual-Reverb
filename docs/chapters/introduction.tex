So why would you want to use \lt instead of Microsoft Word\texttrademark? I can think of several reasons. The main one for this author is that \lt takes care of all the numbering automatically. This means that if you decide to rearrange material in your IS, you do not have to worry about renumbering or references. This makes it very easy to play around with the structure of your thesis. The second reason is that it is ultimately faster than Word\texttrademark. How? Well, after a week or so of using \lt, you will begin to remember the commands that you use frequently and won't have to use the \lt pallet in TeXShop or TeXnicCenter. So, you can just type everything including the mathematics, where with \msw you would have to use the Equation Editor.
