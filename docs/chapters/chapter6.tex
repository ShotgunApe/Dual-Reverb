\chapter{Results}
\hspace*{-0.187cm}This section will discuss how the two different approaches to artificial reverberation perform. It will begin by evaluating how the echo density of the Schroeder Comb Filter approach increases with the number of filters provided. Next, a comparison will be made between the Schroeder Comb Filter approach and the Convolution approach to determine how the purely artificial method compares to a reverb created from the Impulse Response of a real acoustic space. Finally, the chapter will end with where one can improve upon these designs and some of the drawbacks between the two approaches.
