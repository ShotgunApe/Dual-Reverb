Prior to 1960(?), ``artificial reverberators'' were physical devices - that is, [].
The use of artificial reverberators is that of a tool to producsers and musicians. It provides additional color to an otherwise dry sound that can provide a [].

In addition to these reverberation methods, this section will cover how artificial reverberation is used by musicians today. Common music technology will be discussed so that one can understand in what context these algorithms are used. This will include digital audio workstations and virtual studio technology.
