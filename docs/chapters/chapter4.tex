\chapter{Real Acoustic Spaces}
\hspace*{-0.15cm}This chapter will cover impulse responses and their use in artificial reverberation. It will begin with the mathematical background of rooms and how their echo is measured. Next, several methods of measuring a room's impulse response will be discussed. Finally, the measurements taken from an acoustic space will be provided and the results analyzed.
