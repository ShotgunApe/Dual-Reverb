Here is how I plan on introducing you to \LaTeX. The Introduction gives some reasons for why one might find \lt superior to MS Word\texttrademark. Chapter \ref{text} will demonstrate how one starts typesetting a document and works with text in \LaTeX. Chapter \ref{graphics} discusses the creation of tables and how one puts figures into a thesis. Chapter \ref{bibind} talks about creating a bibliography/references section and an index. There are three Appendices which discuss typesetting mathematics and computer program code. The Afterword will discuss some of the particulars of how a \lt document gets processed and what packages the \texttt{woosterthesis} class uses and are assumed to be available on your system.
