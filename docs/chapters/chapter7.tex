\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\hspace*{-0.15cm}This barely scratches the surface. While the topics mentioned in this thesis cover the fundamentals of artificial reverberation, there are many different designs and improvements that can be made over the program as it is described here. Schroeder reverberators are considered a specific case to the more generalized structure known as a \textit{Feedback Delay Network (FDN)}. These structures []. A modernized artificial reverberator will use this type of structure with a diffuser step, should one take the route of a purely artificial design. This is just one area that it is possible to improve upon.

The application can benefit from [].
